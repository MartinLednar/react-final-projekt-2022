# Final project from [Complete React Developer in 2022](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-react-developer-zero-to-mastery/)

# About project
This website is the final project from the React course. We were slowly building it pretty much from the beginning of the course and as we were learning new
technologies we were implementing them on this website. For example, at first we were using just our dummy data => then Context API => then Redux => then Redux-Thunk and 
Redux-Saga. It was really different learning experience as oppose to other courses where you build just one small and simple project for each new technology that
you are currently learning. I really enjoyed this course and building this project.
